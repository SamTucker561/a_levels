# Normal Distribution
### 3.1 - The Normal Distribution
- You can calculate the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a given range.
- A continuous random variable has a continuous probability distribution, shown as a curve on a graph.
- Continuous variables found in real life are more likely to be grouped around a central value rather than take extreme values. E.g heights/weights of animals and size variation in manufactured objects.
- The **normal distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that can be used to model many naturally occurring characteristics that behave in this way.

##### The Curve
- $\mu =$ mean
- $\sigma^2 =$ variance
- $\sigma =$ standard deviation
- The ND curve is symmetrical, bell-shaped, with asymptotes at each end total area under curve of 1.
- Approx 68% of data lies within 1 s.d from mean.
- Approx 95% within 2 s.d
- Approx 99.7% within 3 .sd

### 3.2 - Finding Probabilities For Normal Distribution
- If X is normally distributed, X~N($\mu, \sigma^2$)
- P(X < n) can be found by using the "Normal CD" function on a calculator. Set extreme values for lower/upper bounds if they're not given.)

### 3.3 - Inverse Normal Distribution
- If you know the area under the ND curve that is less than a value, you can find the value with the Inverse Normal function on your calculator.
- If you know the area greater than a value, do $1-Area$ to find the area below, then do inverse.
- **To find values given areas, sketch the curve and mess about with them. (i.e subtracting one area from a calculated one.**
