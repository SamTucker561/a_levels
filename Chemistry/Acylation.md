# Acylation
Acylation is the process by which the acyl group (RCOZ) is introduced into another molecule.
Acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides are two important acid derivatives, and there naming rules are outlined [[Nomenclature|here.]]

### Structure
Acid derivatives have the general formula RCOZ, where Z can be a variety of compounds

| Z      | Name           | General Formula | Example            |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| -OR'   | Ester          | RCOOR'          | Ethyl ethanoate    |
| -Cl    | Acid Chloride  | RCOCl           | Ethanoyl chloride  |
| -OCOR' | Acid anhydride | RCOOCOR'        | Ethanoic anhydride |

The carbonyl group of an acid derivative is polarised:

### Reactivity
In an acylation reaction, the Z group is replaced by an attacking nucleophile.
How readily the acylation reaction occurs depends on three factors:
1. The magnitude of the δ+ charge on the carbonyl carbon, which in turns depends on the electron releasing or attracting power of Z
2. How easily Z is lost (Z is the leaving group)
3. How good the nucleophile is.

Acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides have very δ+ carbon atoms (attached to two electronegative atoms) and so attract nucleophiles easily, making them good acylating agents.

### Nucleophiles & Products Formed
Acid derivatives (acyl chloride and acid anhydride) will react with the following nucleophiles:
With acyl chloride, the reaction takes place at room temperature and white misty fumes of HCl are given off.
With acid anhydride: the mixture must be gently warmed for reaction and no visible change takes place.
This means that although acyl chloride is a good acylating agent, it is not used in the lab due to the toxic fumes it produces.

Acylation reactions form the corresponding products and an acid. For acyl chlorides: hydrochloric acid. For acid anhydrides: carboxylic acid.

The following table lists the nucleophiles in order of reactivity.
> **These reactions are called addition-elimination reactions.**

| Nucleophile     | Product Formed                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Amine R'-NH$_2$ | [[Nomenclature\|N-Substituted Amide]] |
| Ammonia :NH$_3$ | Amide                                 |
| Alcohol :OH     | Ester                                 |
| Water OH-       | Carboxylic Acid                       |

### Mechanism Of Reaction
The reaction mechanism for every reaction is the same in principle:
1. The electrons from the nucleophile attack the δ+ carbon, and the electrons from the C=O bond move to the oxygen, forming a single bond and a negative :O$^-$
2. The nucleophile is now bonded to the attacked carbon, and is positively charged since it gave up electrons. The electrons from the O go back to the C-O bond and those from the C-Z bond (in this case Z = Cl)  go to Z.
3. The leaving group is now separate, and is negative with a lone pair of electrons. The C-O bond has reformed into a C=O bond. The positively charged nucleophile is still attached, and the electrons from an Nu-H bond move to Nu, meaning that an H$^+$ ion will leave.
4. The product and an H$^+$ ion are formed.

- Ethanoic anhydride is manufactured on a large scale, and is used over ethanoyl chloride as:
	- It is cheaper
	- It is less corrosive
	- It does not react with water as readily
	- It is safer, as the by-product is ethanoic acid rather than HCl
