# Aldehydes and Ketones
> Aldehydes and ketones are known as carbonyls and have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O. They have a C=O functional group.

>- Aldehydes have the =O group at the end.
>- Ketones have the =O group elsewhere.

### Nomenclature
The nomenclature rules for aldehydes and ketones are outlined in [[Nomenclature|this note]].

### Physical Properties
- Carbonyl compounds have greater boiling points than alkanes due to dipole-dipole bonds.
- Carbonyl compounds become less soluble as the chain length increases because there are much fewer polar ends to the molecule and compounds must be polar to be dissolved.

### Chemical Reactions
Almost all reactions involving carbonyl compounds involve the C=O bond, as the large electronegativity difference makes the bond strongly polar.
- [[Nucleophilic Addition in Carbonyl Compounds]] - Most common reaction.
