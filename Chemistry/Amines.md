# Amines
- Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the H atoms in the ammonia molecule have been replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.
- Amines are very reactive compounds, so they are useful as intermediates in synthesis - the making of new molecules.

### Naming
- The naming rules for Amines are outlined in [[Nomenclature|this note.]]


### Physical Properties (Primary Amines)
##### Structure
- Ammonia is a pyramidal molecule. 
- Bond angles approximately **107°**
- Amines are polar:

##### Boiling Point
- Primary amines can Hydrogen bond using their NH$_2$ groups. The Hydrogen bonds are not as strong as those formed by alcohols.
- Secondary and tertiary amines have lower boiling points because the branched chains hinder the intermolecular forces of attraction.
- The boiling points of amines are lower than those of comparable alcohols.

##### Solubility 
- Primary amines up to about 4 carbons are soluble in both water and alcohols because they form hydrogen bonds.
- Most amines are also soluble in less polar solvents.
- Amines involving benzene are not very soluble in water as benzene cannot form H bonds.

### Reactivity
- Amines have a lone pair of electrons, which can be used to form a bond with:
	- An H$^+$ ion, when the amine is acting as a base.
	- An electron deficient carbon atom, when the amine is acting as a nucleophile.

# Amines As Bases
- Amines can accept a proton so they are Bronsted-Lowry bases.
- They will react with acids to form salts.
- If a strong base like sodium hydroxide is added, it removes the proton from the salt and regenerates the amine.

- Alkyl groups release electrons away from the alkyl groups towards the nitrogen atom. This is called the **inductive effect**. 
- This makes the nitrogen atom a better electron pair donor, so primary alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.
- Secondary and tertiary amines have two/three inductive effects so are even stronger bases. 
- Arylamines (amines with benzene) are poorer bases because the Benzene ring attracts Nitrogen’s lone pair of electrons towards it, where it overlaps with the delocalised system. The Nitrogen is then a weaker electron pair donor and so less attractive to protons.
- If a strong base like NaOH is added, it removes the proton from the salt and the insoluble amine is regenerated.

# Reactions Of Amines
- Primary amines are produced when haloalkanes are reacted with ammonia. There is nucleophilic substitution of the halide by NH$_2$
- These will then go on to react with more haloalkanes to make secondary amines.
- The same happens for tertiary, and finally **quarternary ammonium salts** are produced.

### Preparation of Amines - Reduction Of Nitriles
- Haloalkanes react with a cyanide ion in aqueous ethanol. The cyanide ion replaces the halide ion by nucleophilic substitution to form a nitrile.
- The nitrile can then be reduced to a primary amine, for example with a nickel/hydrogen catalyst.

### Phenylamines
- Phenylamine is the simplest arylamine, it is made through the nitration of Benzene.
- The nitrobenzene is then reduced to phenylamine using **tin and HCl**, with water as a byproduct.

### Formation Of Amides
- Amines will react with acid chlorides and acid anhydrides. These are nucleophilic substitution reactions and the products are N-substituted amides.

### Uses of Amines
- Amines are used to manufacture synthetic materials such as nylon and polyurethane, dyes and drugs.
- Quarternary ammonium salts are used to manufacture hair and fabric conditioners. They have a long hydrocarbon chain and a positively charged organic group, so they form cations.
- Both wet fabric and wet hair pick up negative charges on their surfaces, so the positive charges of the cations attract them to the wet surface and form a coating that prevents the build-up of static electricity and prevents flyaway hair in hair conditioners.
