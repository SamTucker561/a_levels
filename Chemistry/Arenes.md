# Arenes
> Arenes are hydrocarbons based on [[Benzene|benzene]], C$_6$H$_6$, which is the simplest arene.
### Naming
- [[Benzene]] makes up the route of the name, with the prefixes from whatever functional group is attached. (E.g methylbenzene)
- This is different for carboxylic acid groups, in which case the compound takes the name *-benzoic acid*.
- If there is an alcohol group, the compound is named *phenol*. Alternatively, it can be written as benzene-di/tri-ol (e.g with multiple OH groups).
- If the benzene ring is a substituent group (C$_6$H$_5$-) in another compound, it's called a *phenyl* group.
- If there is an NO$_2$ substituent, it has the prefix *nitro-*.
- If two or more substituents are present on the benzene ring, their positions must be indicated by the use of numbers. This should be done to give the lowest possible numbers. Substituents should be listed in alphabetical order.

### Physical Properties
- Arenes are non-polar and so do not dissolve in water but do mix with hydrocarbons and non-polar solvents.

### Reactivity Of Arenes
- Two factors are important to the reactivity of aromatic compounds:
	- The ring is an area of high electron density, due to the delocalised bonding and is therefore attacked by electrophiles.
	- The aromatic ring is very stable. It needs energy to break the ring before the system can be destroyed. This is called the delocalisation energy. It means that the ring almost always remains intact in reactions.
- Most of the reactions of aromatic compounds are **electrophilic substitution reactions.**
