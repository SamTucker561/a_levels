# Benzene
### Bonding & Structure Of Benzene
- Benzene is a planar molecule.
- In spite of being unsaturated, it does not readily undergo addition reactions.

1. Each carbon has three covalent bonds - one to a hydrogen atom and the other two to two carbon atoms forming an angle of 120*
2. The fourth electron of each carbon atom is in a p-orbital and there are 6 of these.
3. The electrons in the 2p-orbitals overlap and are delocalised and form a region of electron density. **This means the Carbon atoms align on the same plane to maximise bond strength, and is why benzene is planar. **
4. This means that the C-C bond lengths are between C-C and C=C.
5. This gives benzene a very stable structure.

- We can prove that benzene has aromatic stability by finding the enthalpy change of hydrogenation for benzene and for cyclohexene. In reality, benzene has a much lower enthalpy change than cyclohexene because it is much more stable due to the delocalisation.

### Physical Properties of Benzene
- Benzene is a colourless liquid at room temp.
- It has a comparable boiling point with that of hexane but its melting point is much higher as the flat hexagonal molecules pack together very well in the solid state.

### Reactions of Benzene
- Benzene will not decolourise bromine water, neither will it readily undergo any other addition reactions.
- This is because the delocalised system in benzene is stable, and any reactions which break up the system are not favoured. Benzene will instead undergo substitution reactions.
