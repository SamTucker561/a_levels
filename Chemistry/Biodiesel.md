# Biodiesel
A renewable fuel, biodiesel is made from oils derived from crops such as rape seed. Rapeseed oil is a triglyceride ester.

> To make biodiesel, the oil is reacted with methanol (and a strong alkali catalyst) to form a mixture of methyl esters, which can be used as fuel in diesel vehicles.
