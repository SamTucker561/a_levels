# Born-Haber Cycles
> <p style="text-align: center; color: #eb4034;"><b>REMEMBER STATE SYMBOLS AT EVERY STEP</b></p>

A thermochemical cycle that includes all the enthalpy changes involved in the formation of an ionic compound.
> Remember to use the definitions of enthalpy changes. For example, atomising Cl<sub>2(g)</sub> to 2Cl<sub>(g)</sub> is TWICE the enthalpy of atomisation.

Start with the elements in their standard states (Step 1) and then convert the elements into gaseous ions through atomisation, ionisation and electron affinity.

The lattice enthalpy for a particular substance may be different in reality than its calculated value. This is because the bonds in the compound could not be completely ionic, and have some covalent character. The covalent character of a bond is determined by [[Fajan's Rules]].
