### Nomenclature
The nomenclature rules for naming carboxylic acids are outlined in [[Nomenclature|this note]].

### Physical Properties
- Small carboxylic acids are soluble in water (less non-polar ends, can form hydrogen bonds). Up to and including butanoic acid (4 carbons).
- Carboxylic acids have higher boiling points because molecules of a pure acid can form two hydrogen bonds, forming a dimer.

- Carboxylic acids may be differentiated by comparing melting points, which can be measured using a Thiele tube.
### Factors Influencing Ionisation
- The strength of the bond being broken
- The stability of the ions being formed.

### Formation
Carboxylic acids can be formed by oxidising primary alcohols under reflux.

### Reactions of Carboxylic Acids
- [[Acylation|Acyl chlorides]] and [[Acylation|acid anhydrides]] are derivatives of carboxylic acids that are very reactive. They are formed through [[Acylation]]


Since carboxylic acids are weak acids, they show most typical acid reactions. Carboxylic acids will react with the reactive metals, metal hydroxides, metal oxides and metal carbonates.

They can also react by [[Delocalisation of Carboxylic Acids|delocalisation.]]
