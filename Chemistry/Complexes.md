# Complexes
### Aqua Ions
- Transition metal salts, when dissolved in water, are surrounded by water molecules acting as ligands. These complexes are called aqua ions.

### Multidentate Ligands  - Chelation
- Some molecules or ions, called **multidentate ligands**, have more than one atom with a lone pair of electrons which can bond to a transition metal ion.
- For Example:
	- Ethane-1,2-diamine.
	- Ethanedioate
	- Benzene-1,2-diol
