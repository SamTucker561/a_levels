# Electrode Potentials And The Electrochemical Series
### Half Cells
- When a rod of metal is dipped into a solution of its own ions, an equilibrium is set up. For example, Zinc:
- Zn<sub>(s)</sub> <--> Zn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup>
- This arrangement is called an electrode, or a half cell, which must contain both the reduced and oxidised species.
- You can measure the potential difference if you connect two half cells.
- The electrical circuit is completed by a **salt bridge**, which can transfer **ions.**
- The side of an electrical cell that is more negative is the side with the more reactive metal, which is giving out electrons.
- For example, in a Zinc and Copper cell:
- Zn(s) --> Zn$^{2+}$(aq) + 2e$^-$
- Cu$^{2+}$(aq) + 2e$^-$--> Cu(s)
- Combining:
- Zn(s) + Cu$^{2+}$(aq) --> Zn$^{2+}$(aq) + Cu(s)
- If we connect two identical half cells, a potential difference can be generated by changing the position of equilibrium in one or both of the half cells.
- For cells involving non-metals that don't conduct electricity or aren't solid (e.g Hydrogen), a platinum electrode can be used to conduct electricity as it is highly unreactive, and the gas can be bubbled into a solution of ions. (For Hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub> gas is bubbled into a 1.0mol dm$^{-3}$ solution of HCl)

### Conventions
- All equations are written as REDUCTIONS.
- The most negative/reactive equation is written on top.

### The Standard Hydrogen Electrode
- The electrode potential of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode is taken as 0.0V **by definition**.
- The electrode equation is:
- 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> <--> H<sub>2(g)</sub>
- All other electrode potentials are measured relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode.
- The electrode is used under standard conditions. (1.0 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>, 298K, 100kPa)

### The Electrochemical Series

### Representing Cells 

##### Standard Diagram:
**ALSO WRITE THE SALT BRIDGE COMPOUND (KCl or KNO<sub>3</sub>)**

##### Shorthand:
**Cell e.m.f = Right Hand Side - Left Hand Side**

There is shorthand notation for writing down a cell formed by connecting two electrodes:
- Always include state symbols.
- A vertical solid line indicates a **phase boundary**, e.g between a solid and a solution.
- A double vertical line shows a salt bridge.
- The species with the highest oxidation state is written next to the salt bridge.
- Write conductors at extreme ends of the cell.
- If there are two species in the same phase (i.e Fe3+ and Fe2+ in iron cell), they are separated by a comma and the more reduced one is written closer to the conductor.
- (E.g in Hydrogen Half Cells, write Pt(s)|H$_2$(g)|H$^+$(aq) )
- Above: Hydrogen is separated from H+ by a | because hydrogen is in gas phase, H+ is in aqueous.
- In iron half cell: Fe$^{3+}$(aq), Fe$^{2+}$(aq) | Pt(s) **(Platinum is used here as we are interested in Fe$^{2+}$ --> Fe$^{3+}$, not Fe --> Fe$^{2+}$)**
- When giving the value of the emf $E^\theta$ state the polarity of the right hand electrode, as the cell representation is written.
- For example, Aluminium and Copper:
> Al(s)|Al$^{3+}$(aq)||Cu$^{2+}$(aq)|Cu(s)    $E^{\theta}_{cell} = + 2.00V$
- This tells us that electrons flow from aluminium to copper as the polarity of the right hand electrode (copper) is positive.
