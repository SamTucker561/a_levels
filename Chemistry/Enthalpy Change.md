# Enthalpy Change
### Linked Notes On This Page
 We can use [[Hess' Law]] to draw enthalpy cycles and enthalpy diagrams to deduce enthalpy changes for reactions. 
 Alternatively, we can use [[Born-Haber Cycles]].
 
### Definitions of terms
> Mean Bond Enthalpy
>  <p style="color: #eb4034;">Mean bond enthalpy is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous molecules each breaks a covalent bond to form free radicals, averaged over a range of compounds.</p>

> Formation Δ<sub>f</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup> 
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">The standard molar enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements under standard conditions, with all reactants and products in their standard states.</p>

> Combustion Δ<sub>c</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">The standard molar enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when one mole of substance is completely burnt in oxygen.</p>

> Atomisation Δ<sub>at</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">The standard enthalpy of atomisation is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms are formed from the element in its standard states under standard conditions.</p>

> First Ionisation Δ<sub>ie1</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">First ionisation energy is the standard enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms each lose one electron to form a mole of gaseous 1+ ions. </p>
> 

> First Electron Affinity Δ<sub>ea1</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup> - **OFTEN NEGATIVE**
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">First electron affinity is the standard enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms each gain an electron to form one mole of gaseous 1- ions.</p>
> 
> Second electron affinity is positive, as it takes energy to force an electron onto an already negative ion.

> Lattice Enthalpy of Formation Δ<sub>LE</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">Lattice enthalpy of formation is the standard enthalpy change when one mole of solid ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions.</p>
> 
>Lattice enthalpy of dissociation is the opposite process.

> Enthalpy of Hydration Δ<sub>hyd</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
>  <p style="color: #eb4034;">Enthalpy of hydration is the standard enthalpy change when water molecules surround one mole of gaseous ions.</p>

> Enthalpy of Solution Δ<sub>solo</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup>
>  <p style="color: #eb4034;">Enthalpy of solution is the standard enthalpy change when one mole of a solid ionic compound is completely dissolved in excess water under standard conditions.</p>
