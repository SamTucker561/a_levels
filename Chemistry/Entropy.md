# Entropy
> <p style="color: #eb4034;">The randomness of a system, expressed mathematically, is called the entropy of the system and is given the symbol S.</p>

Reactions may be spontaneous if they involve increasing entropy (positive ΔS), even if they're endothermic.
### Gibbs Free Energy Change ΔG
Both enthalpy change and entropy change govern the feasibility of a chemical reaction. These two factors are combined in a quantity called the Gibbs Free Energy, G.
> - If ΔG is negative, the reaction is feasible. 
> - If ΔG is positive, it's not feasible.
> - If ΔG is 0, the reaction is in equilibrium. (I.E at c

ΔG is calculated by:
