# Esters

### Nomenclature
The nomenclature rules for naming esters are outlined in [[Nomenclature|this note]].

### Physical Properties
God knows

### Chemical Reactions
### Formation of Esters
Esters are acid derivatives. They are formed through **Esterification**
>Esters are formed when carboxylic acids react with alcohols, and a strong acid catalyst AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND UNDER REFLUX. This is a reversible reaction.

### Hydrolysis
Esters can undergo [[Mechanism of Hydrolysis|hydrolysis.]]
> The carbonyl carbon atom is 𝛿+ and so is attacked by water as a nucleophile (with an acid catalyst).
> This reaction however does not go to completion, and instead an equilibrium is reached.

> If a STRONG base/alkali is used in hydrolysis e.g NaOH or KOH, the salt of the acid is produced rather than the acid itself. This means the reaction **goes to completion**, so there is more product in the mixture.

### Uses of Esters
Esters can be used for:
- Solvents
- Perfumes
- Flavour Enhancers
- Plasticisers

[[Oils and Fats]], which are comprised of esters, can be hydrolysed into soaps.
[[Oils and Fats|Oils]] can be turned into [[Biodiesel]].
