# Fajan's Rules
Fajan's rules, formulated by Kazimierz Fajan in 1923, are used to predict whether a chemical bond will be covalent or ionic. This depends on the charge and the size of the cations (positive) and anions (negative).

| Ionic               | Covalent             |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Low positive charge | High Positive charge |
| Large cation (+ve)  | Small cation (+ve)   |
| Small anion (-ve)   | Large anion (-ve)                     |

In sodium chloride, sodium has a low positive charge (1), the cation (sodium) is fairly large and the anion (chlorine) is relatively small, and so it is ionic.

Covalent Character is more likely if:

1.  The charge of the ions is higher
2.  The cation is smaller or the anion is larger
3.  The cation has an electron configuration that isn't a noble gas configuration

> <b style="color: #eb4034;">This is because these rules increase the polarising power of the cation allowing it to pull the electron density of the anion toward itself allowing for more covalent character. The greater the polarising power, the more the covalent character.</b>
