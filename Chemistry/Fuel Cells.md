### Alkaline Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells
Reactions:
> $2H_2(g) + 4OH^-(aq)$ --> $4H_2O (l) + 4e^-$   -0.83V
> $O_2(g) + 2H_2O(l) + 4e^-$ --> $4OH^-(aq)$   +0.40V

Overall:
> $2H_2(g) + O2(g)$ --> $2H2O(l)$	$E = 1.23V$

- The cell has two electrodes of a porous platinum-based material.
- They are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.
-  The electrolyte is sodium hydroxide solution.
-  This is the same reaction as burning hydrogen but it takes place at a lower temperature so now nitrogen oxides are formed.
