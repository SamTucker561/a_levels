# Nomenclature
> When naming organic compounds, numbers are separated by commas and letters/numbers are separated by dashes. Letters/letters are joined together.
> Example: 2,2-dimethylbutane

> The functional groups are listed in priority order below, highest first. The highest priority functional group in a compound takes the suffix, and all other groups use their prefix.
> The carbon chain is numbered to put the highest priority functional group first.
> The prefixes are ordered alphabetically, discounting the di, tri and tetra additions.
> The prefixed groups then have their locations numbered; In numerical order, if multiple exist.

> Carbons attached to functional groups are included in counting.


<h1 style="text-align: center;">COMPOUND | SUFFIX</h1>

### Carboxylic Acids | *-oic acid*
> [[Carboxylic Acids]] have the functional group COOH, with a C=O and O-H group on the same carbon.
> When attached to a ring, the suffix *-carboxylic acid* is used and the functional group is not counted as part of the root.
> Example: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid

### Acid Anhydrides |  *-anoic anhydride*
> [[Anhydrides]] have the functional group RCOOCOR'.
> Example: ethanoic anhydride.
> If the alkyl groups are different, both should be named.
> Example: methanoic ethanoic anhydride.
> Pictured: ethanoic anhydride
> ![[Ethanoic Anhydride.png]]

### Esters | *-anoate*
> [[Esters]] have the functional group RCOOR'. Their name is comprised of the alkyl (or aryl) group attached to the root acid, and the acid's prefix with the ester suffix.
> Example: ethyl methanoate.
> ![[Ethyl Methanoate.png]]

### Carboxylate Salts | *-anoate*
> Carboxylate salts are [[Esters]] that have had their R' group replaced by a metal ion. The alkyl group name is replaced by the ion's elemental name.
> For example: HCOONa$^+$. Named sodium methanoate.

### Acyl Chlorides | *-oyl chloride*
> [[Acyl Chlorides]] have the functional group RCOCl.
> Example: ethanoyl chloride

### Amides | *-amide*
> [[Amides]] have the functional group RCONH$_2$.
> Example: ethanamide.
> If the amide has another substituent group attached rather than a second hydrogen, for example RCONHCH3, it is called an *N-Substituted Amide* and is named using the alkyl group attached to the N followed by the original amide name.
> Example: N-methylethanamide.
> ![[N-methylethanamide.png]]

### Nitriles | *-nitrile*
> [[Nitriles]] have the functional group C≡N. They however do not drop the *-ane* suffix of the parent alkane. The group can only be at the end of a molecule, so does not need to be numbered.
> Example: ethanenitrile.

### Aldehydes - C=O group at end | *-al*
>[[Aldehydes and Ketones|Aldehydes]] have a [[Carbonyl Compounds|carbonyl]] group (C=O).
>The C=O group is where chain numbering starts and is not included in the name.
>If a -CHO group is added to a ring, the suffix *-carbaldehyde* is used.
>As the C=O group is always at the end, it does not need to have it's location shown with a number.
>Example: ethanal

### Ketones - C=O group in middle | *-one*
>[[Aldehydes and Ketones|Ketones]] also have a [[Carbonyl Compounds|carbonyl]] group.
>Chain numbering normally starts from the end nearest the [[Carbonyl Compounds|carbonyl]] group.
>The location of the C=O bond must be numbered in ketones longer than butanone.
>Example: pentan-2-one

### Alcohols | *-ol*
> [[Alcohols]] have the hydroxy functional group -O-H, and the prefix *hydroxy-*.
> The location of the -O-H group must be numbered in alcohols longer than ethanol.
> Example: propan-2-ol.

### Amines | *-ylamine*
> [[Amines]] have the functional group RNH$_2$, and the prefix *amino-*.
> Example: ethylamine.
> Amines with Benzene rings are called **phenylamines**

### Alkenes
> [[Alkenes]] have a C=C functional group and the suffix *-ene*.
> The location of the C=C bond must be numbered in alkenes longer than ethene.
> Example: prop-2-ene
> If a C=C bond is present in another molecule, the location of the double bond is denoted with its number and the prefix *-en-*.
> Example: pent-4-en-1-ol

### Alkynes
> Alkynes have the functional group RC≡CH and the suffix *-yne*.
> If a C≡CH bond is present in another molecule, the location of the bond is denoted with its number and the prefix *-yn-*.
> Example: but-2-yn-1-amine

### Haloalkanes
> [[Haloalkanes]] have the functional group C-X where X is a halogen, and the same name as the root alkane. 
> They are prefixed based on what halogen group is present. (*fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, iodo-*)
> The location of the halogen group must be numbered in haloalkanes longer than ethane.
> Example: 1-chloropropane
> If the C-X bond is present in another molecule, only the prefix is used.

### Arenes
> [[Arenes]] are compounds based on benzene.
> Compounds normally take the suffix *benzene*, unless:
> If benzene is present in a carboxylic acid, it takes the suffix *-benzoic acid*.
> If benzene has an alcohol group, it is named *phenol*. If there are two groups, it can be written as benzenediol.
> If a benzene ring is a substituent group in another compound, it is called a *phenyl* group and is a prefix.
> If there is an_2_$ substituent, it has the prefix *nitro-*.
