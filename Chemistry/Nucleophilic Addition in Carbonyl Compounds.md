# Nucleophilic Addition in Carbonyl Compounds
### Reaction Mechanism
![[Nucleophilic Addition in Carbonyls.png]]
> If a carbonyl compound can be attacked from two different angles, for example in ethanal, a 50/50 mixture of two different optical isomers will be formed, known as a racemic mixture. 
> This is possible because the C=O group is flat. (It often results in a planar molecule)
