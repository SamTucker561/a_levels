# Oils and Fats
Oils and fats are esters of the alcohol propane- 1,2,3-triol (glycerol). Oils are liquid at room temperature and fats are solid. Oils and fats contain three molecules of long chain (12-18) carboxylic acids called fatty acids. Since they are based on glycerol, fats and oils are known as triglycerides.

Fats and oils can be hydrolysed in acidic conditions to give a mixture of glycerol and the fatty acids. 

They can also be hydrolysed with sodium hydroxide, producing a mixture of sodium salts of the three acids which made up part of the ester. These salts are soaps. These soaps allow grease and water to mix as the hydrocarbon chain will mix with the grease (non-polar) and the polar and ionic COO<sup>-</sup> group mixes with water.
