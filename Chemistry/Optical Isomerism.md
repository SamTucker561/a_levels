# Optical Isomerism
> A carbon that is bonded to 4 different substituents is a chiral carbon, a chiral center in the chiral molecule.

> Chirality gives rise to optical isomerism, where two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.

- Two optical isomers are also called enantiomers.
- A racemic mixture is a 50/50 mixture of two optical isomers.
- A racemic mixture can form because the C=O bond is planar and an attack from either side is equally likely.
- A methyl and ethyl group count as two different substituent groups.
- You can detect optical isomers with polarised light, as enantiomers rotate the plane of polarised light, by equal angles in opposite directions.
- Since double bonds cannot rotate, they do not give rise to chiral carbons.
