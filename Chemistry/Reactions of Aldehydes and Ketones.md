# Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones
>Alcohols can be oxidised to carbonyl compounds, an carbonyl compounds can be reduced back to alcohols with reducing agents.
### Nucleophilic Addition
Aldehydes and ketones can react via [[Nucleophilic Addition]], as outlined **[[Nucleophilic Addition in Carbonyl Compounds|here]]**.

### Identifying Aldehydes and Ketones
There are reactions that can be carried out to identify whether a compound is an aldehyde or ketone. These reactions include the [[Fehling's Solution Test ]] and the [[Tollen's Reagent Test]].

### Oxidation
Aldehydes can be oxidised to [[Carboxylic Acids]]. 
For example with acidified (dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) potassium dichromate.
Ketones cannot be as easily oxidised as a C-C bond must be broken.

### Reducing Carbonyl Compounds
To reduce carbonyls back to alcohols, we use
> Sodium tetrahydridoborate (III): NaBH<sub>4</sub>

It releases H<sup>-</sup> ions so is a good reducing agent, and H<sup>-</sup> ions act as nucleophiles, resulting in a similar reaction mechanism as in [[Nucleophilic Addition in Carbonyl Compounds|this note]].
Aldehydes --> Primary alcohols
Ketones -->  Secondary alcohols
