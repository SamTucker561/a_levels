# Reactions of Arenes
### Combustion
- Due to the high carbon : hydrogen ratio in arenes, they burn with a noticeably smoky flame.

### Electrophilic Substitution
- The delocalised system of the aromatic compound attracts the electrophile.
- An intermediate ion is formed that destroys the delocalised system.
- To get back the stability, the carbon loses an H+ ion and substitutes it with the electrophile.

### Nitration
- Nitration is the substitution of an NO$_2$ group for one of the hydrogen atoms on an arene ring. The electrophile NO$_2^+$ is generated in the reaction mixture of conc. nitric and conc. sulphuric acids:
> $H_2SO_4 + HNO_3$ --> $H_2NO_3^+ + HSO_4^-$ 
- Sulphuric acid is stronger than nitric and donates a proton.
- $H_2NO_3^+$ then loses a molecule of water to give $NO_2^+$, which is called the nitronium of nitryl ion.
- Overall equation:
> $H_2SO_4 + HNO_3$ --> $NO_2^+ + HSO_4^- + H_2O$ 
- $NO_2^+$ is an electrophile and so reacts according to the above mechanism.
- This results in a nitrobenzene compound, and the removed $H^+$ ion.
- The proton then reacts with $HSO_4^-$ to reform $H_2SO_4$

Nitration is an important step in the production of explosives like TNT, and is the first step in making aromatic amines, which are used to make industrial dyes.

### Friedel Crafts Acylation Reaction
- Aluminium Chloride $AlCl_3$ is used as a catalyst.
- The mechanism for acylation is substitution (as above), with RCO substituting one Hydrogen from the aromatic ring.
- Acyl chlorides provide the RCO group, they react with $AlCl_3$
> $RCOCl + AlCl_3$ --> $RCO^+ + AlCl_4^-$
- $RCO^+$ is a good electrophile that attacks the benzene ring to form substitution products.
- Aluminium chloride is reformed by reaction with $H^+$ to form $AlCl_3$ and $HCl$
