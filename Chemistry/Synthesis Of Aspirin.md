# Synthesis of Aspirin
Aspirin is an over-the-counter medication to treat moderate pain, reduce fever and has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and some cancers. However, it can cause intestinal bleeding.

### Formula

### Formation
It is made by reacting 2-hydroxybenzoic acid with ethanoic acid, or an ethanoic acid derivative. 
The reaction needs strongly acidic conditions, heat and reflux and only goes to equilibrium.
As ethanoyl chloride's reaction is violent and produces fumes of HCl, ethanoic anhydride is the chosen reagent.
