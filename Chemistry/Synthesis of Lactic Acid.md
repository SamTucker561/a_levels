# Synthesis of Lactic Acid
>Lactic acid, 2-hydroxpropanoic acid, has a chiral centre.

### Stage 1
Hydrogen cyanide is added across the C=O bond in ethanal to form 2-hydroxypropanenitrile.

### Stage 2
The nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid group, by reacting it with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction, forming 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

The lactic acid that is produced still has a chiral centre, so a racemic mixture of two enantiomers is formed. In natural processes, usually only one optical isomer is formed as enzymes are used to synthesise these compounds.
