# Mealy Machines
- A Finite State Machine which does not have output is sometimes referred to as a finite state automaton.
- A **mealy machine** is a type of FSM with an output. The output of a Mealy Machine is determined both by its current state and the current input.
- The state transition labels in a diagram are in the format INPUT/OUTPUT
- Mealy machines can be used to represent traffic lights, timers, vending machines, cipher machines and basic electronic circuits.
