# Sets
> A set is an unordered collection of values or symbols in which each value or symbol occurs at most once.

### Defining Sets
1. List each member:
> A = {1, 2, 3}

2. By comprehension:
> B = {n<sup>2</sup> | n ∈ ℕ ^ n < 5 }
> | = "such that"
> ^ = "and"

3. By compact representation:
> A = {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>|n}

### Common Sets
- Empty set: {} or Ø
- Natural numbers, including zero: ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- Integers: ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- Rational Numbers (can be expressed as a ratio): ℚ
- Real numbers (all possible real world quantities): ℝ

### Finite and Infinite Sets
- A finite set is one whose elements can be counted off by natural numbers up to a particular number.
- The **cardinality** of a finite set is the number of elements in the set.
- An infinite set may be countable or uncountable

#### Countably Infinite
Countably infinite sets can be counted off against the set of natural numbers, e.g A = {5n | n ∈ ℕ}
ℝ is not a countable set as you cannot list all the numbers in the set or say which is the next number.

A countable set is one which can be counted off against a *subset* of the natural numbers.

### Cartesian Product Of Two Sets
Written as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B

### Subsets
If every member of A is also a member of B, then A is a subset of B:
A ⊆ B

The sign in the middle can be inverted to denote a superset.

If A is a subset of, but not equal to B, then A is a proper subset of B.
A ⊂ B

### Set Operations
You can perform statistical operations (Union and Intersection) on sets.
You can also calculate the difference, written A \ B, which is all elements in set A but NOT in set B.
