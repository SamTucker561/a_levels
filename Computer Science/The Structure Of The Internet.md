# Structure Of The Internet
- Computers communicate with each other using networks.
- The **Internet** is a network of interconnected networks.
- The **World Wide Web** is a collection of resources accessed via the Internet.

### The Internet's Physical Structure
- Each continent uses backbone cables connected by trans-continental lines fed across the sea beds.
- National **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** connect directly to this backbone and distribute internet connection to smaller providers who in turn provide access to individual homes and businesses.

### Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
- A **Uniform Resource Locator** is the full address for an Internet resource. It specifies the location of a resource on the Internet, including the name and usually the file type.

### Fully Qualified Doman Names (FQDN)
- A **fully qualified domain name** is one that includes the host server name for example *www.*, *mail* or *ftp*.

### IP Addresses
- An IP or **Internet Protocol** address is a unique address that is assigned to a network device. E.g 130.142.37.108
- The **IP address** indicates where a packet of data is to be sent or has been sent from. **[[Routers]]** can use this address to direct the data packet accordingly.

### Internet Registries and Registrars
- **Internet registrars** are needed to ensure that a particular domain name is used by only one organisation. Registrars are responsible for reselling domain names.
- **Internet registries** are five global organisations governed by the Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers (ICANN) with worldwide databases that hold records of all the domain names currently issued to individuals and companies, and their details.

### Domain Name System (DNS)
- A **domain name** identifies the area or domain that an Internet resource resides in. These are structured into a hierarchy of smaller domains and written as a string separated by full stops as dictated by the rules of the **Domain Name System (DNS)**

- Each domain name has one or more equivalent **IP addresses**. 
- The DNS catalogues all domain names and IP addresses in a series of global directories that **domain name servers** can access in order to find the correct IP address for a resource.
