# Circular Motion Practical
This involved us swinging a mass in a circle connected by a string to some weight through a glass tube. Nearly took Antoni's eye out.
- From some silly derivation:

> $v^2 = [g\frac{M}{m}(1-(\frac{m}{M})^2)]L$

Calculated speed:
- 9.03 ms$^{-1}$

Our Results:
- Small mass $m$ = 6.5g
- Large mass $M$ = 100g
- Length $L$ = 54.3cm
- No. of rotations in 5 seconds: 12.5
- Time period $T$ = 0.4s
- Speed  $v$ = 8.53 ms$^{-1}$

Our calculated and theoretical values were in fact quite close together.
