- [[Newton's Laws]]

According to the first of [[Newton's Laws]], an object in a circular orbit has constant speed, but not a constant velocity as the direction is always changing. This means there must be a resultant force acting on the mass.

- Time to orbit once $= T$
- Speed $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$
- Angular speed/frequency $w = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ (radians s<sup>-1</sup>)

We can combine these two to get $v = rw$
Radians travelled in a time interval $∆Θ = w∆t$
After moving, the velocity vector has changed.
The change in velocity is towards the centre of the circle.

Using small angle approximations, we can say that:
> $∆v= v∆Θ$
> $\frac{∆v}{∆t} = v\frac{∆Θ}{∆t}$
> Therefore $a = vw$
> $a = \frac{v^2}{r}$

Multiplying both sides by mass gives us:
> $ma = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
> Therefore $F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
> This is the equation for centripetal force.

Centripetal force is at 90$\degree$ to the velocity so does not do any work on the object so it stays at a constant speed.

The force does change the direction mass $m$ goes in which changes the direction but not the magnitude of the velocity vector.

Mass $m$ is accelerating towards the centre of the circle but does not get closer to it.
