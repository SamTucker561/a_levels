# Flux Changes And Force
> **We did practical 6.1.1d(ii) from page 371 of the OCR A Level Physics B book to complement learning this topic.**

### Teslas & Webers m$^{-2}$
- The magnitude F of the catapult force depends on the electric current $I$, the length $L$ of the wire in the uniform field, and the flux density $B$.
- The **Tesla ($T$)** is defined as the force per unit current per unit length of conductor perpendicular to $B$. It is a measure of the $B$-field strength.

### Field At An Angle
- In order to figure out the force exerted on an object in a magnetic field, we only consider the perpendicular component of the magnetic field. 
- Use trigonometry to figure out the perpendicular component.
- This generally results in:
