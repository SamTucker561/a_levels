# Gravitational Potential In A Radial Field

> In a non-uniform field, gravity is not the same strength everywhere.

- We know that $\Delta GPE = mg\Delta x$ (x = displacement/height)
- We also know that $\Delta GPE = m\Delta V$ (V = gravitational potential)
- Combining them, and cancelling out mass:

> $g = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}$
> -

- If we rearrange to get $V = gx$, and plot it as a graph, the gradient of the graph $\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}$ is known as the "gravitational potential gradient", and is the same thing as the gravitational field strength $g$.
- However, since g is negative and the gradient of the graph is positive:

> $g = -\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}$
> -

### Changing Potentials
- An object at a distance r from mass M will experience a gravitational field strength of

> $g = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$
- And will have Gravitational Potential:

> $V = -\frac{GM}{r}$
- In Joules per kilogram.

- In the case of objects in our solar system, they have Gravitational Potential as a result of being within the Sun's gravitational field.

### Graphs
##### g Against r
- In the below graph, the area under the graph  between r and ∞ represents the gravitational potential $V_g$ at distance r.
- The area between two points on the graph is $\Delta V$

##### F against r
- If we instead plot a graph of the gravitational force F between a mass and r, the area under the graph between r and ∞ represents the $GPE$ at distance r.
- The area between two points on this graph is $\Delta GPE$
