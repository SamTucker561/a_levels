# Gravitational Potential (In A Uniform Field)
- Near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity is approximately uniform. Close up, the gravitational field is perpendicular to the ground and acts directly downwards.

### Gravitational Potential **Energy**

- Work done (in Joules) to lift a mass through height h:

> $W = mgh$
> -

- This is equal to the Gravitational Potential Energy (**GPE**) gained.

### Gravitational Potential
- **Gravitational potential  = GPE per kilogram**, using sea level as GPE of 0.
- V is the symbol for Gravitational Potential (units: Jkg<sup>-1</sup>)

> $V = \frac{GPE}{m}$
> -

- Since the masses on each side of the fraction cancel out, we end up with

> $V = gh$
> -

- An **equipotential line/surface** is a line across which gravitational potential is constant.

### Gravitational Potential Difference - Finding Velocity After A Fall
When a mass falls from one height to another height it is traversing a Gravitational Potential Difference.
> $\Delta V = V_{final} - V_{initial}$
> -

- Therefore, to find the change in GPE:

> $\Delta GPE = m\Delta V$
> -

- The GPE lost while a mass is falling is equal to the kinetic energy it gains.

> $\Delta KE = -\Delta GPE$

- We can use this method to find the change in velocity when a mass falls between two points, using the equation for Kinetic Energy.

> $\Delta mgh = \Delta \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

### Fields
In a gravitational field, the direction of the force (the field lines) are always perpendicular to the equipotential lines.
