# Electromagnetism
### Fields and Flux
- A magnetic field is represented by lines of flux passing from the North to South pole of a magnet. 
- The unit of flux is the Weber (Wb)
- **Magnetic flux density** is a measure of the strength of a magnetic field, and it shows how close the flux lines are to each other. Given the symbol B

### Flux $\phi$ and Flux Density $B$
- Flux and flux density are related by the equation:

> $\phi = BA$
> --

- Where A is area.

### Electromagnetic Induction
- Any change in magnetic flux in a circuit will result in the **induction** of an e.m.f across that circuit.
- The rate of change of flux in a circuit is proportional to the e.m.f induced in that circuit.
- Values of $\phi$ are very small for typical magnetic fields, so many coils are used.
- **Flux linkage** = number of coils x flux through one coil.
- **Induced e.m.f = rate of change of flux linkage**:

> $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta (N\phi)}{\Delta t}$
> --

### Lenz's Law
- The induced current in the solenoid will produce flux in the opposite direction to the original flux, reducing the flux increase, and opposing whatever change has caused the increase in flux.
- **The direction of an induced e.m.f is always such as to act against the change that caused the induced e.m.f**

### Faraday's Law
> Induced e.m.f $\epsilon = -\frac{d(N\phi)}{dt}$
> --

- The minus sign is a reminder of Lenz's law - the induced e.m.f will produce a current which opposes the rate of change of flux responsible for the induction.
