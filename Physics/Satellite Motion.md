# Satellite Motion
- Mass of orbited body (Earth) = M
- Mass of satellite = m
- DIstance from orbited body = r
- Time period = T
- Centripetal Force = Gravitational Force = F

### Calculating Time Period For 1 Orbit
When answering a question like this, we should follow very clearly the following steps. **Make sure to differentiate m and M.**
> Centripetal force = Gravitational force
> $\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$
> - The minus sign in the GMm equation does not need to be used here as the minus sign simply denotes that the force is towards the center of the Earth (in vector form). 
> - The Centripetal Force equation is a magnitude and the Gravitational Force equation is a vector.
> 
> The mass of the satellite cancels out, as does one of the radii.
> Therefore:
> $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$
> However, we also know that $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$
> Equating our two expressions for v, and squaring them:
> 
>  $T^2 = \frac{4\pi ^2}{GM}r^3$
> ---
> This is called Kepler's 3<sup>rd</sup> Law of planetary motion:
> $T^2 ∝ r^3$

### Geostationary Satellites
- Must be above the equator.
- Any mass of satellite can be used.
- Must be at specific radius.
