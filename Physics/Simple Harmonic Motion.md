# Simple Harmonic Motion
### Simple Harmonic Oscillators
- Time period time for one swing = $T$
- Displacement of an oscillator varies about an **equilibrium position.**
- **Amplitude** $A$ of an oscillation is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
- The **natural frequency** of an oscillator is the frequency at which it oscillates after being displaced. Usually found by measuring the time for 10 oscillations and then finding the time period.

### Conditions For SHM:
- Acceleration is proportional to displacement. (F ∝ -x)
- Acceleration is always towards the equilibrium position.

### Acceleration of an SHO
An oscillator will show simple harmonic motion if:
> The acceleration is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium.
> The acceleration is always directed towards the equilibrium position.

If we differentiate a graph of displacement $x$, we get an equation for velocity:
> $v = -A\omega sin(\omega t)$
> -

By differentiating a second time, we can get to the equation for acceleration, resulting in:
> $a = -\omega ^2x$
> -
