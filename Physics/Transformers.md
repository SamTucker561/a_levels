### Magnetic Circuits
- An electrical circuit consists of a potential difference across a continuous conducting loop in which charge will flow.
- A magnetic circuit can be constructed in a similar way, as the lines of flux all form closed loops.
- The flux is created by a current $I$ in a solenoid of $N$ turns.
- The equivalent of p.d in the magnetic circuit is $I$ x $N$. 
- This 'magnetic e.m.f' will be referred to as **current-turns**.
