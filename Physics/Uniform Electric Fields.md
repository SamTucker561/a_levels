# Uniform Electric Fields
### Analogy With The Gravitational Field
- For gravitational fields:

> $g = \frac{F_{grav}}{m}$ ($F_{grav}$ = Force Due To Gravity)

- The electric field acts upon charges.
- For electric fields, field strength E:

> $E = \frac{F_{electric}}{q}$
> --

- For uniform fields, the force is constant, so the work done is:

> $W = mgh$ for gravitational.
> 
> $W = qEd$ for electric.
> --

- As $1V = 1JC^{-1}$, we have $V = \frac{E}{q} = \frac{W}{q}$
- Rearrange to get $W = qV$
- Now we have two equations for Work Done, so we can equate them:
- $qV = qEd$
- $V = Ed$
- Finally:

> $E =\frac{V}{d}$
> --

- And using our equation for E:

> $\frac{F_{electric}}{q} = \frac{V}{d}$
> -

### Equipotentials & Representing A Uniform Field
- Equipotential surfaces link points of equal potential from equally spaced planes in a uniform field.
- The field lines go from a the higher (positive) potential to the lower (ground/negative) potential.
- The field becomes non-uniform near the edges of the two charged plates.
- The equipotential surfaces are **perpendicular** to the field lines. (Make sure this is also true where the equipotentials change direction at the ends)
- $E = \frac{V}{d}$ can only be used where the E-field lines are straight.
- Where the field becomes non-uniform, the following equation can be used:

> $E = -\frac{dV}{dr}$
> -

- Where r is the distance measured along the field line. 
- The minus sign in the equation shows that the direction of the E-field is in the opposite direction from the increase in $V$.
