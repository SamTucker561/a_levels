# Using Models of Simple Harmonic Motion
### Model of a Pendulum
(Angles in ***Radians***)
> When the pendulum is at equilibrium, tension in the rope  $T=mg$
> 
> When the pendulum is at angle $\theta$, the component $mgsin(\theta)$ will be the accelerating force.
> 
> Using $F = ma$, we can cancel for $m$ and rearrange to get $-gsin(\theta) = a$
> 
> If $\theta$ is small, $sin(\theta) = \theta$, so we can say $-g\theta = a$
> This shows that <b style="color: #eb4034;">acceleration is proportional to angular displacement.</b>

> If $x$ is horizontal displacement and $L$ = string length, $\theta = \frac{x}{L}$

### Final Equation - Might Be Used In Practical Questions
> By combining our equation for $\theta$ and our equation for $a$, we get:
> $a = -[\frac{g}{L}]x$
> Then, using $a = -\omega ^2x$, and $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$:
> $4\pi ^2f^2 = \frac{g}{L}$
> **Finally**, by using $f = \frac{1}{T}$, we can do some rearranging to get:

 > $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$
