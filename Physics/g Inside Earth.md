# g Inside Earth
### Important Result:
> Gravity increases linearly from the centre to the surface of Earth.
> Gravity inside Earth: $g=-\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}r$


Represent Earth as a shell.

$\sigma = \frac{M}{4\pi r^2}$ $\sigma$ = mass of each square metre in surface of the earth/shell.

If we take two different patches on the shell, no matter how different they are in size, there will be a point within the shell between them where the resultant gravitational field strength is 0.

If we add up all patches across the shell, the total gravitational field strength inside the sphere is 0.

This means at any point P within the shell, the total gravitational field strength is 0.

## Determining g inside Earth
Density of Earth = $\rho$
When determining g inside of earth, all mass outside of the radius r does not affect g. 

![[Gravity inside earth.png]]

Mass inside r = $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho$ 
Since $g = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$:
> Gravity inside Earth: $g=-\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}r$

When inside Earth, the weight of an object is simply F = mg, using the equation for g as above. []()

Therefore, using F = ma, a = gr

As the acceleration is directly proportional to the displacement (r), the object will show ***simple harmonic motion***.
